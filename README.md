# Microservice Application

## Overview

### What is Microservice?
A microservice architecture is a method of developing software systems that tries to focus on building single-function modules with well-defined interfaces and operations. It allows an application to be broken down into smaller, independent services, each responsible for a specific functionality. This architecture enables scalability, flexibility, and ease of deployment, as each service can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

### What is Docker?
Docker is an open-source platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization. Containers allow developers to package an application and its dependencies into a single, portable unit that can run consistently across any environment, making it easier to manage and deploy applications.

### What is Kubernetes (K8s)?
Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It helps in managing complex microservice architectures by providing features like service discovery, load balancing, scaling, and self-healing.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js with TypeScript**: The backend of this microservice application is built using Node.js with TypeScript, which provides a strongly-typed programming language that compiles to JavaScript.
  
- **React**: The frontend is developed using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.

- **Docker**: Docker is used for containerizing the application, ensuring consistency across various environments, and simplifying deployment.

- **Kubernetes (K8s)**: Kubernetes is used for orchestrating the Docker containers, allowing for easy scaling, load balancing, and management of the microservices.

- **Jest and SuperTest**: These tools are used for testing the application. Jest is a JavaScript testing framework, while SuperTest is used for testing HTTP requests in Node.js.

- **NATS**: NATS is a lightweight, high-performance messaging system that facilitates communication between microservices.
